- This project will help us solve rubik 3x3 with give direct in each face rubik and and we will rotate according to the instructed steps

- File draft_to_test_range_color_BGR is used to find a range color(HSV) of six color in rubik. You should modify depends on your lighting condition

- File Solve_Rubik is the main file to solve rubik based on kociemba algorithm
- Steps:
      1. Identify the 9 squares of each face and assign a color value to each(1->6 corresponding to 6 colors)
      2. Find 6 faces of the Rubik's cube including top, bottom, front, back, left, right face
      3. Combine 6 faces together
      4. Use kociemba algorithm to give solution steps
      5. Follow the instructions and complete

- Limits of project:
  + Depend on your lighting condition
  + Algrithm is complex
  + Code is not optimized

- Hope you like this project and learn more about Computer Vision
